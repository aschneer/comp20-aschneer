All aspects of this assignment have been implemented
correctly.  Ms. Pacman has been drawn on top of the
Google background using only Javascript.  The
"onload" field of the spriteSheet image object
has been used to ensure that the image loads
completely before the image is drawn to the canvas.
The sprite sheet image and the example image
on the assignment page were measured carefully
in GIMP image editor in order determine the
exact pixel coordinates, width, and height of
each component image.  The images were drawn
relative to an arbitrary reference point.  In
other words, each image was drawn relative to the
reference point, rather than the absolute
coordinate system.  This way, the images
are "grouped", and they can easily be moved
on the web page by simply changing the coordinates
of the reference point.  This was done by
doing simple math to convert relative coordinates
to absolute coordinates.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this
assignment.  I utilized the javascript and
<canvas> documentation that was posted on
the assignment page, as well as other online
resources.

I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
