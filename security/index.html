		<h3>Introduction:</h3>
		<p>
			This product is a web server that
			serves the geographical locations
			of its clients.  Clients are able
			to communicate with the server via
			specific HTTP requests.  Server
			functionality includes adding a
			client's login and location to the
			server database, returning a specific
			user record from the database,
			returning the entire contents of the
			database, and listing a history of
			all records that were added to the
			database in the form of a web page
			with entries logged by timestamp.
			<br><br>
			I have been hired as a security
			consultant to document and resolve
			the security and privacy issues in
			a classmate's web server.
			<br><br>
			I have defined "Low"
			severity vulnerabilities as being
			non-detrimental, bad practice, or
			causing reduced functionality
			without compromising the security
			or privacy of the site.  "Medium"
			severity means either the client
			or server side is vulnerable, but
			not both.  "High" severity means
			both the client and server
			components are at risk.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section" id="methodology">
		<h3>Methodology:</h3>
		<p>
			The basic strategy for finding
			client-side vulnerabilities was
			to try cross site scripting (XSS)
			at every entry point into the
			site that was available.  These
			entry points included both the
			POST route to /sendLocation and
			the GET route to /location.json.
			Various HTML tags were inserted into
			these two places and observed the
			results.
			<br><br>
			Crashing the server was also attempted by
			overwhelming the database, with no
			success.  A linux bash script was used
			to send many, large POST requests to
			/sendLocation with different login names
			to try and fill up the database.
			It was found that even when POST requests
			were sent with the
			longest text string that cURL would
			accept for the login name, the database
			still functioned.  In addition, even
			after sending 100 different POST
			requests with slightly different login
			names using the bash script, the site
			still functioned properly.  Below is the
			bash script that was used.  With more
			time, the number of POSTs could be increased
			to 500 or 1000 to try and crash the database,
			but it does not look like that would
			be very easy.  Also, at a certain point
			cURL would refuse to run when the login
			string became too long.
			<br><br>
			<img alt="Bash Script" src="./methodology_01.png"/>
			<br><br>
			The tools that were used include cURL (UNIX)
			and Firefox web browser, particularly
			the devloper tools such as the HTML
			element inspector and the
			javascript console.

		<h3>Abstract of Findings:</h3>
		<p>
			This report outlines the security
			vulnerabilities that were found
			at <a href="https://protected-meadow-7856.herokuapp.com/">https://protected-meadow-7856.herokuapp.com/</a>.
			Several cross-site scripting
			threats were found, as well as
			a minor data type malfunction.
			The datatype malfunction allowed
			non-numeric values to be stored
			and rendered as latitude and
			longitude coordinates.  Although
			not detrimental in terms of
			security, this flaw limited the
			functionality of the site.
			More importantly, the site was found
			to be susceptible to both script
			and style injection into the
			/sendLocation POST and
			/location.json GET routes.
			These issues opened the site up
			to almost any possible
			malicious code execution or
			style tampering on the client
			side.  In lay terms, this means
			that an unauthorized user could
			completely change the appearance
			and content of the site by simply
			inserting key phrases into the
			areas of the site that are designed
			to accept user input.  Such a user
			could also plant viruses which could
			leak information about other users
			or their computers.
			Solutions to these problems
			include verifying the type of
			data input to the site, as well
			as either removing or replacing
			all "<" and ">" characters with
			their corresponding HTML
			character entities so that code
			from outside sources would not
			be run on the site.  The cost
			of implementing these changes
			would be very low, so it is
			highly recommended that they be
			done immediately.

								<br><br>
								Although this is a significant
								issue in terms of functionality,
								it is not a security threat.
								The fact that the site displays
								"NaN" for some of its lat/lng
								data does not make it vulnerable
								to malicious intentions.  It
								simply means that the site does
								not function as well as it could
								for its intended purpose.

						</li>
						<li class="lev2">
							<p>Description</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								POST requests to /sendLocation
								are not validated for proper
								data types.  Non-numbers can
								be input for lat and lng values
								and they are shown in the log
								as "NaN".  In the database,
								they are stored as "null".
								This issue was found by sending
								non-numeric input as a POST
								to /sendLocation.  It was
								observed
								that the data was displayed as
								"NaN" on the log page.  It was
								determined that the data was
								stored as "null" in the database
								by sending "?login=[name]" as
								a GET request to /location.json.
								The database entry was then
								returned.  This same
								database entry
								was also returned upon
								successfully completing the POST
								request.

								Use a validation library to check

								library for this is Chriso's
								validator.js, which can be found
								<a href="https://github.com/chriso/validator.js">here</a>.
								The isFloat() function can be used
								to check if a piece of data is
								a floating point number.

							<p>Description</p>

							<p>
								The site is vulnerable to script
								injection (XSS) from POST requests.
								When script tags with javascript
								code are sent to the server as
								the login name, the code runs on
								the page when the HTML is rendered.  This threat was found
								by trying to inject empty
								HTML script tags into
								the "login" field of
								the database and then observing
								the results.  It was found that
								the script tags were being
								stored in the database (checked the /location.json
								returned database entry) but
								not printed to the page.  The
								HTML element
								inspector in Firefox then showed
								that the script tags were in
								fact making their way into the
								HTML DOM.  Once it was known that
								the script was being injected
								successfully, an alert()
								function was sent in the
								script tags
								to demonstrate the threat.

								Search all POST request content
