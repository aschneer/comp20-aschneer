This assignment was implemented correctly.
I focused on the javascript and not on the
styling, so the styles of the messages
are not beautiful.

I spent approximately 1.5 hours on this
assignment.

I received some general advice and
tips from Sibonay Koo, also a
student in COMP 20, as I worked through
this assignment.

The XMLHttpRequest requests will only
be served if they target the same host
from which the original page was loaded.
This is called the "same-origin policy".
"Same origin" means that the protocol,
port, and host must all be the same for
both the page requesting the data, and
the host serving the data.  This important
security measure ensures that websites
can't make requests to other servers
where a user might have private information
stored without them knowing.
