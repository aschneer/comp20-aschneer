All aspects of this assignment have
been implemented correctly.

I received help from Sibonay Koo with
retreiving the value typed into the
input box.  I had been using
jQuery.attr("value") but it was not
working.  Sibonay encouraged me to
use $("input#msg").val(), which wound
up working.

I spent approximately 4 hours on this
assignment.  It shouldn't have taken
this long but I had a lot of trouble
pulling the input string from the
HTML input box.  For some reason,
it was very difficult to find a guide
for doing this online.  I searched
many times and could not get a clear
answer.  Normally I have no problem
finding answers online, but for some
reason I couldn't find example code
for this.
