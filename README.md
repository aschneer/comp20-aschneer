###Purpose of Git Repository:
The purpose of this Git repository is to be
a central location for all the projects
I worked on as a student in COMP 20,
Web Programming, with Ming Chow, at
Tufts University.

###Favorite Lab or Assignment:
My favorite assignment was
probably assignment 2, the
Real Marauder's Map.
This assignment
gave me a taste of a lot of
different web programming
concepts in one shot, including
AJAX, API/server interaction, and
the Google Maps API.  This was
the first web programming project
I did which resulted in a
finished product with extensive
client-side functionality.

###How Much Have I Grown:
I have grown a lot since day
one of the course.  In the
beginning, I had a very minimal
understanding of how the
internet worked.  Now, I fully
understand the
request-response, client-server
model.  I now understand
what a web browser actually
does, and how it does it.
I was on the fence about
taking this course initially
due to scheduling challenges.
I figured that there were
enough online resources for
me to learn web programming
on my own.  However, looking
back, I would have been lost
in the beginning without the
fundamental concepts that I
learned in this class.  I now
feel like I have a good enough
foundation of knowledge
to understand and
tackle almost any web
programming/engineering topic,
with further research.

###Most Important Thing I Learned:
The biggest
takeways I got from this course
were the request-response model,
asynchronous programming, and
the difference between client-
and server-side web programming.  For example,
I now know how to communicate
with a server over HTTP using
GET and POST requests.

I also
know that when programming in
any event-driven, asynchronous
language, like Javascript,
callback/event functions are
the only ways to guarantee
the timing of code.  Subsequent
lines of code do
not necessarily
run in sequence.  Callback
functions must be used to
control the order of tasks
in an asynchronous program.

Finally, I now understand
how client-side programming
differs from server-side,
or in other words, front-end
vs. back-end.
I know that client side code
is always public and
lives/runs on a client's web
browser.  This code is
downloaded by the client's
machine when they make HTTP
requests to the server where
the client-side code is stored.
Server-side code is the code
that handles the HTTP requests
and then delivers the
client-side code to the
clients.  The server that
serves the front-end code
is the one that clients
interact with directly.
However, this server can then
interact with other servers
over HTTP to get other
information.  Thus, one
website can use an array of
servers to get information
to its clients, storing
different data and performing
different tasks on the
various servers.  In addition,
the website can use 3rd
party servers, such as APIs
for companies or
organizations, to collect
information, process it, and
deliver it to a client.

This information is all very
empowering because it makes
me realize the true potential
of web programming.

###Topics I Want to Explore Further:
I would like to learn more
about server-side programming,
particularly making REST APIs,
and also databases.
I am intrigued by the idea of
being able to serve information
to clients through simple
request-response communication.
This model, coupled with a
database, has tremendous
potential.  Today, many websites
and services have a REST API
associated with them.  This is
extremely valuable for
developers because it gives them
the opportunity to very easily
make the world a better place
by giving millions of people
access to information that they
would not otherwise have.
Giving people access to
information is very
important in order to have a
well-informed, socially-just
society.  Information is power.

I want to learn more about
databases as well.  It seems
as though almost every modern-
day programming project involves
databases.  If I can master
databases, I will be able to
tackle a lot of coding
challenges with more
confidence.

I also want to
experiment
with being able to control a
server completely through
HTTP requests.  This means
POSTing code which the server
will then replace its current
code with.  This will allow
me to completely control another
computer remotely, all through
HTTP.  I can also POST code
which will be run on the server
machine, separate from the
server code, such as BASH
scripts.  I do not know if this
is possible, but I want to
look into it further.  There
might be services that already
do this, like remote desktop,
so I will look into those
as well.
