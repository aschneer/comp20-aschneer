###Assignment 4 - Server Security Analysis
###04/24/2015

This assignment has been implemented
correctly.  Five security vulnerabilities
were found in my partner's website,
and suggested solutions have been outlined
for all of them.

I collaborated with TA Lucy Qin on this
assignment, mostly for suggestions on
how to find security vulnerabilities.

I spent approximately 8 hours on this
assignment.  Honestly, most of the time
was spent formatting the HTML report page.
